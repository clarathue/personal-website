Professional Business Intelligence Solutions with AI-Chatbots and System Integration.

**Live URL**: https://thuemecke.net/

## Project Overview

This is a modern, responsive website built with React and TypeScript, showcasing Clara Thümecke's Business Intelligence and AI solutions. The site features a clean, professional design with smooth animations and optimized performance.

## Website Structure & Main Sections

This website is structured into several key sections, each serving a specific purpose for visitors and SEO:

- **Hero**: The landing section with a strong headline, value proposition, and call-to-action to engage visitors immediately.
- **About**: Introduces Clara Thümecke, her background, expertise, and approach to business intelligence and AI solutions.
- **Services**: Overview of the main services offered, such as AI-Chatbots, System Integration, and Process Automation.
- **Use Cases**: Real-world examples and scenarios demonstrating how the solutions can be applied in different industries and business contexts.
- **Contact**: A visually distinct section inviting users to get in touch, linking to a dedicated contact page.
- **Footer**: Contains navigation links, legal information, and social/contact links for easy access from any page.

Each main page (e.g., AI-Chatbots, System Integration) follows a similar structure, with tailored content, benefits, and case studies relevant to the topic.
